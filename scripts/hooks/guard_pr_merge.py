"""PreToolUse hook: gate `gh pr merge` on the three things a merge assumes.

`main` auto-deploys, so `gh pr merge` is the command that ships to production.
Step 6 of `/builder-bot` already names three preconditions for it. All three
held only as long as the model's attention held: in a weak-evaluator panel one
run merged a PR while writing "code reviewed" in its close-out, having run no
review at all. The instruction was present and correct the whole time. That is
the shape of rule that belongs in a hook rather than in prose — not because
the wording is bad, but because the wording is a prompt handed to the same
model that is deciding whether to follow it.

The three gates, in the order they are checked:

1. **Ownership.** The PR's author *and* its head repository owner must both be
   the owner of this repo. The repo is public; a fork's branch is a stranger's
   code, and merging it is a deploy. Checked first because Step 6's rule is not
   "do not merge it" but "do not merge it, do not check it out, do not run its
   gates" — so nothing else should run against a PR that fails here.
2. **Required checks green on the current head.** Read from branch protection
   live, never from a list written down anywhere, because that list has rotted
   twice (#1504, #1584). `statusCheckRollup` is head-scoped, which is what
   closes the stale-`--watch` trap: a green run belonging to an older push is
   simply absent from it.
3. **A review artifact exists.** `.claude/reviews/<N>.md`, non-empty.

**This hook denies when it cannot answer.** A failed `gh` call, a timeout, an
unparseable payload, unreadable branch protection — all deny. A gate that
fails open is not a gate, and every one of these failures is loud and fixed in
minutes.

# ponytail: gate 3 is a sentinel, not a proof. It cannot judge a review; it
# only forces the step to leave something behind, which is exactly the failure
# observed (a claimed review with no output). If thin files become the dodge,
# the upgrade is to have `/code-review` write the file itself with the head
# SHA in it, and check that SHA here.

INSTALL
-------
Merge into `.claude/settings.json`, alongside the existing Bash hook:

{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Bash",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "python \"$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/scripts/hooks/deny_raw_issue_comments.py\""
          },
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "python \"$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/scripts/hooks/guard_pr_merge.py\""
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}

Then verify in a *new* session, so settings reload:

    gh pr merge 1 --squash        # must be denied (no review artifact)
